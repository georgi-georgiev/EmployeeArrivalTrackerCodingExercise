Instead of callbackURI, the API can accept a unique identifier of client.
Creates a message queue for the client and return a reference to this specific queue (URL, identifier of the message queue or something similar).
The client does not need to wait for the whole operation to complete and can start listening to the queue.
Short-term calls are more reliable, less chance for timeouts and network issues.
Then the service should create a background job which publish data to the message queue with marker for the succesfully processed request.
The job must be retriable in case of failures connecting to the queue and starts again from the last unsuccessful request(prevents duplications).
In this way the API is responsible for delivering the data only to the message queue.
The service and client are entirely decoupled (no direct dependency).
If the client goes offline by some reason the queue will still be populated.
When the client is online again can start reading from the queue.
